# Guitar Modulatron 3000

Simple Web App for practicing modulations on a guitar.

Work in progress, still buggy. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.



## TODO

### Cleanup

- Make sure I'm consistent with note number values (i.e. 1-12 or 0-11) -- string offsets, root values, start for playableNotes

- Some style weirdness when note is root of one and in other scale but not it's root

- Can use only the top scale selector, but not only the bottom one

### Features

- indefinite number of strings, w/ ability to add / remove and set tuning for each

- responsive
